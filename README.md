Introduction


The Babysitter Connect App is a powerful and convenient platform designed to streamline the process of connecting parents with reliable babysitters. Say goodbye to word-of-mouth searches and embrace a modern, user-friendly approach to find the perfect babysitter for your needs. This README file provides an overview of the app, its features, and how to get started.

Features

1. Search by Criteria
Easily find babysitters that match your specific criteria. The app allows parents to search for babysitters based on factors like location, availability, experience, and more. This feature ensures that you can quickly identify babysitters who meet your unique needs.

2. Personal Profiles
Each babysitter has their own dedicated personal profile. Parents can view detailed information about babysitters, including their qualifications, certifications, and previous experience. This transparency helps parents make informed decisions when selecting a babysitter.

3. "Wanted" Page
Parents can post detailed babysitting requests on the "Wanted" page. Specify the date, time, and any specific requirements you have for a babysitter. This feature makes it easy for babysitters to browse and respond to babysitting opportunities that match their availability and skills.

4. Language Standards
Our application enforces the use of appropriate language throughout the platform. We have implemented a language filter to maintain a respectful and professional environment for both parents and babysitters.
